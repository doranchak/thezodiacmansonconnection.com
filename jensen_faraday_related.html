              received your e-mail concerning the Zodiac and, yes, I was the
              driver of the sports car that night in December 1968.&nbsp; I was
              born and raised in Vallejo, and I was living with my parents at
              that time.&nbsp; My former girlfriend who had moved to San
              Francisco was visiting her parents in Napa and had just purchased
              a sports car.&nbsp; She dropped by our home in Vallejo, and since
              I was going to get up early to go hunting with my father the next
              morning, instead of going out, we decided to go for a ride and
              catch up.&nbsp; She asked if I wanted to drive her sports car, and
              I went down Lake Herman Road to see how the car handled.&nbsp;
              There is a place where a private road intersects the main road.&nbsp;
              There is&nbsp;a gate across the private road maybe thirty yards
              down it.&nbsp; It provided a spot known to local teens as a place
              to &quot;park&quot; and I will leave it at that.&nbsp; This night
              I was in a small two-seater and &quot;parking&quot; was not in the
              picture.&nbsp; I had just went through the gears and pulled into
              the private road area and turned the car around with the front
              pointing to and a few feet from the main road.&nbsp; The engine
              was running and the lights were on.&nbsp; I had never driven a car
              that had toggle switches on the dashboard.&nbsp; As my former
              girlfriend was explaining to me what each one controlled, I
              noticed a car coming down the road from the direction of Benicia.&nbsp;
              The car passed in front of me and then I noticed that it came to a
              stop and its taillights told me it was backing up.&nbsp; Common
              sense suggested to&nbsp;me to put the sports car in gear and
              leave. I pulled out and started driving toward Benicia.&nbsp; The
              other car backed into the area where I had been parked, turned
              around and in a second or two was behind me.&nbsp; The car hit its
              bright lights and then did a bright off, bright on, bright off,
              etc.&nbsp; I went through a few young testosterone moments where I
              was going &quot;to pull over and kick this guy's ass&quot;.&nbsp;
              My former girlfriend starting getting upset and I&nbsp;sped up.&nbsp;
              The car behind me also sped up, and at one point as I was looking
              over my shoulder the car behind me came up on my side with its
              right front fender near the driver's rear quarter panel and
              appeared to be moving toward making contact.&nbsp; I shifted to a
              lower gear and hit the gas.&nbsp; There is a fork in the road
              where one continues towards Benicia and the other more towards the
              freeway toward Vallejo.&nbsp; The other car was clearly chasing me
              and I waited until the last moment and then turned off.&nbsp; The
              larger car behind me could not make the turn.&nbsp; I went down
              approximately two hundred yards and stopped in the middle of the
              road.&nbsp; The other car had stopped shortly after the turn-off.&nbsp;
              Each of us sat there in the road. Again, youthfully stupid, I
              yelled about kicking his ass.&nbsp; After some moments, the other
              car turned around in the roadway and went back down the road from
              which we had come. I kept making macho statements, but not totally
              without some sense about me, I&nbsp;drove home.&nbsp; I did not
              see the car again.&nbsp; I could not see the passenger seat, but
              the driver was a man with short hair and glasses.&nbsp; I did not
              see his specific facial features.&nbsp; The two from Benicia were
              killed exactly at the same place where I was parked that night
              when I first encountered the other car.&nbsp;Therefore, in my
              opinion, he&nbsp;either randomly came upon that spot or was from
              the area and knew of it.</font></td>

              there was a description. I put my shotgun in the car, as if he
              would really still be there&nbsp;and drove back out Lake Herman
              Road to confirm the location.&nbsp;I came home and told my mother

              of the car that had chased me.&nbsp; She suggested that I report

              County Sheriff. I was interviewed and gave an account.&nbsp; I

              A few years ago, a sheriff I knew&nbsp;who was reviewing the

            could kill and began his search by chasing that sports car. We see
            how the white Chevy stopped and observed the couple, then sped away.
            This was similar, in some respects, to the Vallejo attack when
            Zodiac pulled up to the Ferrin car and then left. Of course that
            time he went back. Perhaps in both instances he was deciding just
            what to do. It can be speculated that after the chase the driver of
            the Chevy (Zodiac) saw the Faraday station wagon parked at the

				I was&nbsp;determining what the toggle switches controlled&nbsp;when the

				As I was watching the car pass, I noticed that he stopped and
