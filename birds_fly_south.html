				We interpret this as saying, �If you want the Zodiac killer then

				that a reporter had found out that there was a United Flight 555 
				that flew from San Francisco to San Diego every Wednesday at 
				7:30 PM. This direction of flight seems to confirm the pasted 
				words &quot;birds fly south&quot; as San Diego is south of San Francisco. 
				Bird(s) is slang for a plane. It is also a slang term in Great 
				Britain for young females (the Zodiac�s British connection -

				The flight number, 555, is interesting. In neo-Nazi literature 
				this is used as Hitler's party number. Zodiac had sent a letter 
				on Hitler's birthday, 4/20/70. Bruce Davis married Nancy Pittman 
				(who Manson had called one of his �best assassins�) on this very same month, day and year! Manson and Davis both idolized 
				Hitler.&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Manson

				The same number, 555, (an occult number) was used 
				by Aleister Crowley, the British black magician, and&nbsp;Manson 
				and&nbsp;Davis both followed his teachings. Zodiac killed Paul Stine 
				in San Francisco on Crowley's birthday.</span></font></td>
