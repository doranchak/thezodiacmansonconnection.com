              REAL OPINION: OPINION The Magistrate has filed his report and
              recommendation pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. �
              636(b)(1)(B) and General Order 194 of this Court recommending
              issuance of the writ requested by petitioner. The Court disagrees
              with the recommendation and is of the opinion that the petition
              should be denied. Petitioner was convicted in the Superior Court
              for Los Angeles County on two counts of violation of California
              Penal Code � 187 (first degree murder) and one count of violation
              of California Penal Code
              � 182.1 (conspiracy to commit murder and robbery). He now
              challenges the convictions upon the following grounds: 1. Denial
              of his constitutional right of self-representation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>2. Coercion of the jury to return a verdict. 3. Intimation
              by the trial judge that a guilty verdict should be returned by the
              jury. 4. Substitution of an alternate juror during deliberations.
              Grounds 2, 3 and 4 are factually unsupportable by the record of
              the trial and no violation of the constitutional rights of the
              defendants is proven upon those grounds. Petitioner contends that
              he was unconstitutionally denied the right of self-representation
              guaranteed him by the United States Constitution and expressly
              held absolute in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct.
              2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). Petitioner was tried in 1972 and so
              the Court must find Faretta (supra) retroactive before petitioner
              can receive the benefits of that Supreme Court opinion. The
              California Supreme Court in People v. McDaniel, 16 Cal.3d 156, 545
              P.2d 843, 127 Cal. Rptr. 467 (1976) eschewed the retroactivity of
              Faretta. This Court finds no reason to disagree with the searching
              analysis made by Chief Justice Wright writing for a unanimous
              court in McDaniel. Petitioner argues that although Faretta may not
              be held to be retroactive that he is entitled to relief
              nonetheless because the Ninth Circuit had determined that the
              right of self-representation was a constitutional right. He relies
              on Bittaker v. Enomoto, 587 F.2d 400 (9th Cir. 1978) and Walker v.
              Loggins, 608 F.2d 731 (9th Cir. 1979) to support his contentions.
              In this regard he reads too much into those decisions. Relying on
              Arnold v. United States, 414 F.2d 1056 (9th Cir. 1969) and Bayless
              v. United States, 381 F.2d 67 (9th Cir. 1967) the Court in
              Bittaker and Loggins (supra) held that a state defendant had a
              constitutional right to self-representation before the Supreme
              Court's decision in Faretta. In its reliance on Arnold and Bayless
              (supra) the Ninth Circuit in Bittaker and Loggins does not clearly
              define this right as &quot;absolute&quot; and as such California
              courts were free to make determinations of competing rights of
              fair trial not addressed to &quot;convenience or efficiency of the
              trial.&quot; Bittaker (supra) at p. 403, but rather to a
              fundamental concern that defendants undertaking to represent
              themselves appreciate the seriousness of the charges and present a
              meaningful defense in cases involving liberty and possibly even
              death. This case presents the question classically for the trial
              judge found only superficial understanding of substantial
              procedures that would seriously compromise petitioner's defense in
              a capital case. Fair trial rights can have no less importance in
              the administration of justice than can the right of
              self-representation now raised to constitutional dimensions of
              absolutism in Faretta. n1</font></td>

              CHAMBERS OPINION: Davis was convicted in California in 1972 of two
              counts of first degree murder and of one count of conspiracy to
              commit murder and robbery. He was sentenced to concurrent life
              sentences with the judge's recommendation that he not be released
              during his lifetime unless the California Adult Authority was
              convinced that he would not be a danger to the community. We
              have reviewed the arguments raised by Davis and find them to be
              unpersuasive. We restrict our discussion to the single issue of
              his right to represent himself at his trial. When he sought to
              assert this right at the outset of his trial, after careful and
              thorough questioning, the judge centered his attention on Davis'
              ability to conduct his defense so as to preserve his
              constitutional rights. He then concluded that Davis was not
              authorized to waive his constitutional right to representation by
              counsel, a determination that was consistent with California law
              prior to the United States Supreme Court's decision three years
              later in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45
              L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). The subject was thereafter renewed but again
              the trial judge, after questioning Davis, concluded that Davis
              ought to have the services of an attorney for the effective
              presentation of his case within constitutional standards then
              applicable under California law. An appeal was taken to the
              California court of appeal and Davis' attorney presented a variety
              of issues, many of them raising claims of error in matters of law,
              e. g. the denial of motions for change of venue, for the quashing
              of petit and grand jury panels, for severing of counts; error in
              the admission of evidence and giving of instructions; a claim of
              prosecutor misconduct, etc. In a lengthy opinion, the California
              court of appeal rejected these claims of error and also rejected a
              claim, made in Davis' reply brief, that he had been denied a
              federal constitutional right to represent himself under Faretta v.
              California, which was decided three years after Davis' trial, but
              while his appeal was pending. The court of appeal's discussion of
              the Faretta issue consumed less than a half of a page of the
              extensive, 79-page, typed opinion. The court summarily denied
              relief on this issue stating that Faretta had recently been held
              to be non-retroactive by the California Supreme Court in People v.
              McDaniel, 16 Cal.3d 156, 127 Cal. Rptr. 467, 545 P.2d 843 (1976.)
              n1 The judgment of conviction was affirmed, the California Supreme
              Court denied a hearing, and the United States Supreme Court denied
              certiorari.</font></td>

						<font color="#FFFFFF">In
              January 1979, Davis (again through his attorney) filed an
              application in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.
              No such application had been made to the state court. He contended
              that Faretta was retroactive in effect. He also argued, now for
              the first time, that even if it were not retroactive, the law of
              this circuit prior to the decision in Faretta had required that he
              be granted his motion to represent himself. The district judge
              denied the writ and Davis appealed to this court. 487 F. Supp.
              651. In determining that Davis was required under California law,
              then in effect, to have the assistance of counsel, the trial judge
              obviously considered and articulated those aspects of his inquiry
              that were relevant to the law that was then in effect. He had
              little reason to anticipate Faretta and even less reason to
              anticipate a claim that Faretta would be applied retroactively. On
              this record, we cannot tell whether the reasons he expressed were
              the totality of his reasons for refusing to allow Davis to proceed
              in propria persona. The district judge's opinion, discussing his
              reasons for denying the writ, focused on the trial judge's
              thorough questioning of Davis in the light of the complexities of
              the case, reasons now discarded by Faretta. But his opinion also
              states: &quot;Davis' request for leave to proceed pro se in the
              context of similar requests by co-defendants Charles Manson and
              Susan Atkins could well have persuaded the trial judge to deny
              Davis such leave in an effort to avoid the strong probability of
              disruption.� In this circuit, before Faretta, the right to
              self-representation could be denied if a defendant engaged in, or
              there was reason to fear, obstructionist or unruly conduct. United
              States v. Dujanovic, 486 F.2d 182 (9th Cir. 1973). Nothing in
              Bittaker v. Enomoto, 587 F.2d 400 (9th Cir. 1978), says otherwise,
              and Justice Stewart's statement in Faretta, is of some importance:
              &quot;... the trial judge may terminate self-representation by a
              defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist
              misconduct.&quot; 422 U.S. at 834, fn. 46, 95 S. Ct. at 2541, fn.
              46.The brutality of these murders, the association of Davis with
              Manson and Atkins, and the widespread publicity about the
              purportedly bizarre activities of members of the &quot;Manson
              family,&quot; may have been a concern to the trial judge. We
              simply have no way of knowing if this was so or if, perhaps, there
              had been conduct by Davis or by potential witnesses or spectators
              that might have affected the trial judge's view in denying the
              motion to proceed in propria persona. The trial judge is still
              serving actively on the California bench and we believe that we
              should afford the state the opportunity for a hearing as to the
              reasons that led him to deny Davis' motions to represent himself.
              Then probably state relief should be exhausted on the point of
              Ninth Circuit law, raised here for the first time. Given the state
              of the record, we believe it would be improper at this time to
              address the broader constitutional question of the retroactivity
              of Faretta. Remanded to the district court with the suggestion
              that it vacate its order denying the writ. Full jurisdiction is
              back in the district court, and if the petitioner returns to this
              court, it would be on a new appeal.</font></td>

              CHAMBERS, Circuit Judge: In Davis v. Morris, 657 F.2d 1104 (9th
              Cir. 1981), we considered Davis' contention that he had been
              unlawfully denied the right to represent himself at his murder
              trial in the California state courts in 1972. The district judge,
              in his opinion denying a writ of habeas corpus, had stressed
              evidence of the trial judge's obvious concern for Davis' ability
              to represent himself competently in this very serious criminal
              matter. 487 F. Supp. 651 (C.D. Cal. 1980). He also noted that the
              fear of disruptive activity could well have influenced the trial
              judge's decision to deny the request to proceed in propria
              persona. See United States v. Dujanovic, 486 F.2d 182 (9th Cir.
              1973). As the trial had occurred long before Faretta v.
              California, 422 U.S. 806, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562, 95 S. Ct. 2525 (1975),
              had been decided, and as the record suggested a basis for the
              district judge's evaluation, we remanded the case to the district
              court to permit a fuller inquiry into the trial judge's reasoning
              in denying self-representation. Counsel for the parties appeared
              before the California trial judge, who made a statement of his
              recollection of the case and of the decision with respect to
              Davis' motion for self-representation. The judge then invited
              counsel to ask questions and we detect no limitations in that
              process. He answered questions and a transcript was prepared of
              the entire proceedings. On a review of that transcript the
              district judge again denied the writ on the ground of the
              petitioner's incompetency to represent himself and also on the
              ground of the atmosphere of potential disruption. We find no
              prejudice to the appellant as the result of this manner of
              proceeding. Rhinehart v. Gunn, 661 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1981).
              Moreover, we have reviewed the transcript of the proceedings
              before the trial judge and we conclude that in the factual
              circumstances of this case, there was ample warrant for the denial
              of Davis' attempt to represent himself both under pre-Faretta and
              post-Faretta law. The motion for self-representation was made at a
              time when Davis was a co-defendant with Charles Manson and other
              members of the so-called &quot;Manson family.&quot; The trial
              judge described the courtroom appearances of other members of that
              &quot;family&quot; as spectators, distinctive by their shaved
              heads and by the markings on their foreheads. Significantly, he
              remembered: ~ There was a coordination of activity between the
              Manson people. When Charles Manson did something, they nearly
              always followed it, so that even Steven Grogan and Susan Atkins,
              who could hardly put one sentence one after the other, made
              motions to proceed pro per because Charles Manson did and because
              Davis followed suit. ~ The trial judge stated that Manson
              &quot;was inclined to be disruptive of almost any proceeding where
              he was present.&quot; The close association between the
              codefendants was definitely in the judge's mind and he was
              concerned &quot;for the usual and orderly course of a presentation
              at a trial.&quot; He noted particularly the fact that ~ . . .
              there was no lack of communication, so far as I was able to hear,
              between the prisoners. They were all in custody, of course, but
              they were even allowed to, for the purpose of the trial, associate
              with each other and to meet from time to time. ~ It was his
              conclusion that Charles Manson would have been &quot;calling the
              strategy.&quot; Counsel inquired: You mentioned something before
              that Charles Manson was sort of calling the shots as to his
              followers. Based upon this at the time you made the ruling, did
              you believe that Bruce Davis could make a knowing and intelligent
              waiver of counsel? ~ The trial judge responded, &quot;I didn't
              think he could . . . I thought he wasn't acting independently, in
              any event.&quot; After Davis' case was severed from that of Manson
              and Atkins, the following statement was made by the court: Very
              well. The court will take it that the stipulation will prevail as
              to any pretrial motion, that it is deemed to have been made in
              this proceeding just as it was in the proceedings -- in the
              proceeding before this court prior to separation of the defendant
              for trial. ~ Counsel for the defendant stated: Well, Your Honor,
              initially, if I may, I would like to incorporate -- incorporate
              the proceedings had in the prior trial when all the defendants
              were joined, at which a motion to quash the petit jury venire was
              made. And the court -- there was at that time certain evidence
              introduced. There were certain stipulations entered into. I would
              request that those same matters be deemed presented by way of
              evidence and the same stipulations stipulated to by both sides. ~
              It thus appears that no specific motion for self-representation
              was reasserted at this time. The trial judge stated that, on this
              record, &quot;I would say -- it would just be guessing and
              speculating -- that the motion to proceed pro per would not have
              been considered by me at that time.&quot; The record demonstrates
              that following the severance of Davis' case from that of the other
              defendants, evidence of changed circumstances (if any) was not put
              before the court in sufficient form as to any change of
              circumstances warranting a reconsideration of the denial of that
              motion for self-representation. On this record, appellant cannot
              claim he was improperly denied self-representation after the
              severance of this case from the others. The representation of
              Davis on this and the former appeal has been of the highest
              quality and we commend his attorney. We rest our decision on the
              factual circumstances of this case, as attested to by the judge
              who tried it, by the review of the district judge, and by our own
              review of the record. The writ of habeas corpus was properly
              denied. Affirmed.</font></span></td>
