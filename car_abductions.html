            Davis lived, at times, at Spahn Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. At the Ranch
            there were rodeo performers that had and wore dress cowboy suits and
            boots. The Family would sometimes use their clothes and cars. After
            cowboy actor Shorty Shea was killed by Bruce Davis and the Family,
            Davis was seen wearing Shea's cowboy boots. One teenaged girl was seen
            wearing his cowboy shirt. Shea was poor and worked at the ranch so
            his boots were probably very worn. Davis had a friend with a
            Corvette and Davis was, on occasion, seen driving it. It is unknown
            if it was the same year and model that Harrison saw or was seen by
            the CHP at the Graham scene. The man seen helping Robin Graham was
            about 25 to 26 with dark brown hair. Davis was 28 with dark brown
            hair. Harrison did not pay that much attention to the hair of the
            man who approached her but hair can be easily lightened or darkened.
            At least one former member of the Manson Family thought that freeway
            or stalled-car abductions was something that Davis was
            &quot;into.&quot; Everyone in the Family feared Davis the most and
            he has been called a &quot;cold-blooded murderer.&quot;</font></td>

            Mulholland became chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water Company in
            the 1920s. He was responsible for many water projects in the Los
            Angeles area. The Mulholland name became synonymous with water. A
            road that wound through the Santa Monica Mountains was named
            Mulholland Drive in his honor. Unfortunately, he had a dam built
            that later collapsed. Some 500 people perished. It is interesting to
            note that some of these abductions (and maybe more) have a link to
            Mulholland Drive. Is this further evidence of the Zodiac's and/or
            the Family's connection to water?</font></td>
