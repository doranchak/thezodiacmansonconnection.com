				1978, that the KHJ Zodiac letter was sent, after a long period 
				of no communication from Zodiac, and also that the Manson 
				Family was mentioned by name in the letter. It is very 
				possible that during another "episode" and while under 
				medication, Davis thought that by writing a "Zodiac letter" it 
				might cause some kind of change. What that wanted change would 
				be is hard to tell if one is mentally disturbed! This letter 
				does call Susan Atkins a&nbsp;"Judas" or one who had betrayed the 
				Family. Perhaps he was going to do a follow-up letter and ask 
				for the Family's release or he would carry out his threat as 
				&quot;Zodiac.&quot; Recall that Zodiac wrote in August 1969 that if his 
				demands were not met he would "kill 12 people." In December 
				1969&nbsp;Zodiac had contacted Melvin Belli, the nation's top 
				attorney,&nbsp;pleading for (legal) "help." This was at exactly 
				the same time that the 
				Family was going down fast. In December 1969 the Tate/LaBianca 
				case was announced as being solved. LA Police Chief Ed Davis, 
				one of the persons the above letter writer wrote that he planned to kill, had 
				announced this and Daryl Gates, another person the above letter writer 
				planned to kill, was the head of the Manson investigation at 
				LAPD.</font></span></td>
