              the first officer that responded to the scene. I was working with
              an officer who's since deceased, Frank Peda, an excellent police
              officer, and we responded to a radio call. Told us that a cab
              driver was being robbed, and/or possibly assaulted at the corner
              of Cherry and Washington streets, in Pacific Heights. We,
              fortunately, were very close and responded to that corner and we
              were able to do so, red light and siren, at 9:55 at night, and got
              there very quickly. I parked the car in the middle of the
              intersection, facing the yellow cab that was sitting a little back
              from the corner of Cherry Street, on Washington, facing west on
              Washington. There were three children that were heading over to
              that car. They weren't too far away, but I'd say a good 15 or 16
              feet away. I made the assumption that they were coming from the
              home on the corner and I was correct, and I herded them
              immediately back to that alcove. I didn't know if the suspect was
              still there. The description that came out over the air was of an
              NMA, negro male adult, at the time. The only person that couldn't
              [sic - could've] given that information would've been the child who called it in to
              police dispatch. Whether somebody wrote it incorrectly and the
              child actually said, &quot;White guy,&quot; I don't know.</font></span></td>

              the front seat with his head into the well on the passenger side
              in the front. There was blood all over the cab, on him, and I was
              99.9% certain he was dead. And it was at that point that I retook
              the description of the suspect. And that's when I was told it was
              a white male. I couldn't get to the radio fast enough at that
              point to let everybody else know. The kids had told me that
              whoever had done this crime left the cab, went out the door,
              seemed to be wiping the cab down, reaching into the cab and then
              ambling or walking down Cherry Street in a northerly direction,
              kind of towards the Presidio. I walked that way myself, I did not
              run because there are innumerable alcoves and parked cars, so I
              went down following every technique I knew so I didn't get my head
              blown off. Got down to the corner of Jackson Street, had to make a
              choice. I was on the east side of the street, so I turned right to
              the east, went up in that direction. I couldn't see anybody in
              either direction, nor could I see anybody scaling a wall into the
              Presidio. I got all the way down to the next corner which was
              Maple. Decision number two, which way to go? Looked to the left,
              toward the Presidio, saw absolutely nothing. It was much darker
              there. I figured the chance of finding somebody was almost nil. I
              turned to the right and I saw a man walking his dog. He was
              somewhat older than the description I had, a whole lot thinner,
              and he had absolutely no blood on his clothes. I asked that
              gentleman if he saw anybody walking in the area and he told me,
              &quot;No.&quot;</font></span></td>

              turned West on Jackson Street. As we approached Maple Street, I
              noticed, on the North side of the street, a white male adult,
              dressed in a Derby, or three-quarter, waist-length jacket with
              elastic at the waist and on the cuffs, and regular flap-down
              collars. He had a crew cut, he was wearing rust-colored, pleated
              trousers, which were unusual for the time. He had on
              engineering-type boots, low-cut shoe, three-quarters of the way in
              length, tan in color. The initial radio description of the suspect
              was that of a black male, 5'10&quot; or something like that.
              Seeing that it was a white male in an affluent neighborhood,
              walking along the street, we didn't think it was a suspect. So we
              proceeded to the next block, which was Jackson and Cherry. Turned
              southbound on Cherry Street, saw Armond Pelissetti, one of the
              officers who had responded directly to the scene.</font></span></td>

              tell you what color they were. It was dark enough that his eyes
              were concealed. But you could say he sort of looked down. Perhaps
              this lumbering gait, sort of stumbling along, like a semi-limp,
              might have come up in my mind, because he was putting his head
              down when he spotted the police car, and turned into the
              entranceway of a house. By entranceway I mean stairs leading up
              that are concrete to a path that leads to a front door. Never saw
              him get to the top of the stairs. You want the address of that
              residence? . . . Jackson Street. I never put it in the report and
              I don't think that I have told anyone. I didn't think about it in
              the report, because I assumed that he didn't live in the
              neighborhood, an upper middle-class neighborhood. I don't know if
              he lived there or he didn't live there. Let the inspectors follow
              through. I thought that's what I wrote in the scratch all these
