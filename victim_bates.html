              <p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF9933" size="2">Cheri Jo Bates, a popular 18-year-old girl with blue eyes and blonde colored hair, had been a cheerleader at Ramona High School in Riverside, California. In 1966 she had just graduated and began attending Riverside City College (RCC). With aspirations of being a flight attendant, she was working part time as a clerk typist at RCC and also as a teller at Riverside National Bank.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF9933" size="2">On October 30th there was a full harvest moon in the astrological sign of Taurus. Taurus "rules" the throat. (When Nikki Benedict was killed on May
              1, 1967 the Sun was in Taurus.) In the evening, Cheri decided to go to the RCC library annex to do some studying and check out some books. At one point on her way there she was observed being followed very closely by a 1965-66 Oldsmobile. (Quite possibly this could have been the killer stalking Cheri. Later he could have easily changed cars.) The situation in the library that night was uneventful, but one thing that happened would eventually become very important to the investigation. A brown haired man with a beard, estimated to be around 25 years of age, was seen talking to a young blonde haired woman. While Cheri was in the library a man sabotaged her car by disabling the distributor. He then went back into the library and possibly went to the rest room first to wash the grease off of his hands.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF9933" size="2">At 9:00 P.M. the library closed. It is unknown how much time went by before Cheri arrived at her VW. As she was trying to start her car this man approached offering to help. As greasy palm and fingerprints showed, he made an attempt to "fix" the car for her. (Kathleen Johns' abductor offered to help her, too.) This could have taken any amount of time but at some point he finally "gave up" and offered to give her a ride. She accepted (again like Johns) and while they were walking in a nearby alley he told her it was "about time." She quizzically asked, "About time for what?" He retorted it "was about time for [you] to die."</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#FF9933" size="2">He began choking her and there was a great struggle. For how long? We don't know. He then used a small knife to inflict numerous wounds (See her autopsy report below.) and finally cut her throat. A blood curdling scream was heard around 10:30 P.M. and a short time later the sounds of an "old car" starting up were heard. An old Studebaker was seen parked on Riverside Dr. that night. Footprints left at the scene revealed that the killer wore military dress shoes. (Part of his deceptive demeanor.) The killer's paint flecked military Timex watch (the band had a seven inch circumference) was found about ten feet from Cheri's body. Investigation showed that this watch was purchased in a military exchange store (PX) in the United Kingdom. Some hairs were found in her hand. The DNA was tested against that of the Riverside
              Police Department's (RPD) "local boy" prime suspect.</font><p align="center"><font color="#FF9933"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">The
              RPD has stated that Cheri Jo Bates was stabbed some
              42 times thereby&nbsp; indicating that their &quot;local boy&quot;
              suspect was the perpetrator. That number of stab wounds would
              clearly show it as being personal revenge. However,
              recent (information as of September 1999) FBI DNA tests
              showed that he was not the right man.</font></span>&nbsp; </font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">(See

              Also,
              many serial killer victims have been stabbed
              numerous times and subsequent investigation has shown that the
              killer did not know the victim.</span></font><p align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF9933">By
              the time of day that Cheri Jo Bates was attacked, it was already
              the ancient Celtic Fire Festival (or the Celtic New Year) in that
              part of the world. This is called &quot;Samhein&quot; (pronounced
              &quot;sow-in&quot;; rhymes with &quot;cow&quot;) or &quot;The
              Feast of the Dead.&quot; Some scholars believe that human
              sacrifices were offered up on this festival day. (The 1967 letters
              said, &quot;BATES HAD TO DIE....&quot;) &quot;Samhein&quot; was
              also the final harvest of the year. It was the Irish descendents
              of the Celts that brought us Hallowtide or Halloween.</font></span><p align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF9933">There

              Water held a very important place in the symbolic teachings of Celtic / Druid lore. Charles Manson studied these subjects and in at least one taped interview affirmed Druidism. Manson instructed the Family that, whenever possible, they were to conduct their "activities" near water or it's symbolic representation. As Manson went so went Bruce Davis - both believed alike.<br>
