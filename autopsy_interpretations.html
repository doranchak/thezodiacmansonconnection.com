            violent acts committed against her is amazing (especially after I
            read about her abduction and the short time interval during which
            the killer(s) held her captive.) This leads me to believe that more
            than one person was involved. I feel the killer(s) knew Ms. Habe and
            had extreme anger/resentment towards her. I did not read about the
            abduction (involving at least 2 people) until after I had finished
            my review of the autopsy, so I came to this conclusion
            independently.</font></td>

			<tr>
				<td><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second, she had very few defense wounds but no signs of bondage. To
            me this means one of two scenarios likely occurred. Either she was
            held down manually (though I doubt this - while not absolutely
            necessary, I would expect to see bruising in the pattern of
            hands/fingers on the victim's wrists) or she was too incapacitated
            to fight. Incapacitation could be due to drugging or
            semi-consciousness caused by head trauma, strangulation, or
            exsanguination (if the first stab/cut was one which caused major
            bleeding).</font></td>

            wounds to the lower chest and abdomen are. The neck wounds could
            easily be caused by the same small knife I believe was used on the
            upper chest. Depending on this pathologist's definition of
            &quot;punctuate,&quot; these wounds could be caused by the small

            wounds were made using the full length of the knife (the contusion
            caused by the hilt, or handle, as it hits the skin). Additionally,
            the sternum was stabbed through and through (which takes a good deal
            of force -enough to drive the entire knife in!) yet the mediastinum
            was relatively unscathed and the heart was untouched.&nbsp;This
