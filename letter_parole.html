              <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Dear Board of Prison Terms:<br>
              <br>
              My name is Barbara Hoyt. I was a prosecution witness in the many Manson
              trials, including the Shorty Shea murder trials. I testified against Bruce
              Davis, Steve Grogan, and Charles Manson.&nbsp; I have now 30 years later watched the parole
              hearings for Bruce Davis and read the transcripts for Steve Grogan, provided to me by Bill Nelson. Both
              of them have grossly misrepresented the facts to you. About a week or two
              after the Aug. 16, 69 sheriff's raid at Spahn's ranch, in the afternoon, I
              was sitting on a rock in the parking area in front of the boardwalk. Near
              me were Brenda, Gypsy, and Squeeky. One of them said, as Shorty walked towards
              George Sphan's house, "there goes Shorty snooping around again" and
              another one answered her " yea well, he'll be taken care of."<br>
              <br>
              One night not long after, I went to go to sleep in one of the trailers at
              the back of the ranch overlooking the creek bed below. At about 10 o'clock
              at night, just as I laid my head on the pillow, I heard a long, loud, blood
              curdling scream, which came from about 50-75 feet away from me from up
              stream. Then it was quiet for a minute or so, and then the screams came
              again, and again, again, again,....They seemed to go on forever.<br>
              <br>
              I recognized the screams of Shorty's voice. I can still hear those
              screams today, exactly as I heard them that night. I have absolutely no doubt that
              Shorty was being murdered at that time.<br>
              <br>
              Early the next morning, I asked Gypsy, who was in the Rock City Cafe at the
              ranch house end of the board walk if she had heard Shorty screaming last
              night, and she told me very sternly that Shorty had gone to San Francisco.&nbsp;
              Later that morning Charlie was bragging to Danny DeCarlo about how "Shorty
              committing suicide with a little help from us." Charlie went on to say " I
              stabbed him and Shorty asked, "Why Charlie? Why?" and I told him this is
              why! And I stabbed him again, that he was real hard to kill when we brought
              him to NOW.  That we all kept stabbing him until Clem cut his head
              off! And we cut him up into 9 pieces and buried him around the ranch."&nbsp;&nbsp;
              He asked Danny "if lye or lime would get rid of the body." I was only a
              couple of feet away from Danny at the time and Charlie knew that I was
              there.<br>
              <br>
              I didn't see the murder even thought I did try to look out that window
              and I obviously I don't know exactly how they killed Shorty but his death must
              have been very painful to make him scream as he did. But I do know that
              Shorty was killed at about 10 o'clock at night, under a full moon, and not
              in the afternoon as the killers are telling you. I also know that the&nbsp;
              murder occurred about 50+ feet up stream from the ranch and not the mile or so
              down Santa Susanna Pass road again as the killers are telling you.<br>
              <br>
              Bruce has told you that he was afraid of the family, and that he was afraid
              of Tex. This is a blatant lie, because Bruce was older and vying for a
              leadership role in the family, or at least a second in command to Charlie.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;He was the only other male to have worn Charlie's embroidered vest. He
              lectured like Charlie when Charlie was not there. Other members in the
              family killed more people for Charlie but knowing that the family was
              committing murders, Bruce wanted to lead them.<br>
              <br>
              I am well aware that the body of Shorty Shea was recovered intact and was
              not dismembered as Charlie had claimed. And that his body was located about
              where they claimed to have killed him. They may have buried him there but
              it is not where he was killed.<br>
              <br>
              I am against Bruce Davis getting a parole date for 3 reasons:<br>
              <br>
              1) Because he wanted to be a family leader even though he knew the family
              was committing murder {i.e. Gary Hinman} and not just to follow Charlie.<br>
              <br>
              2) He is lying even to this day about the time and place of the murder.<br>
              <br>
              3) I believe he is lying about fearing Tex, people in the family were more
              afraid of Bruce than Tex.<br>
              <br>
              I find it curious that even as he professes to be a Christian today that he
              is still lying to you.<br>
              <br>
              Thank you for considering my letter and I request my address not be
              revealed to the inmate or to his attorney (who would give him that information)&nbsp;<br>
